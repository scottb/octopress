So blogging is a thing. I'm not so convinced that *everybody* has
something worthwhile to say, but I've been doing this programming thing
for a while now, and I suppose it's possible I've learned a thing or
two that somebody might find useful.

This page is just housekeeping--just checking that everything is working
as advertised. Since I like math, I'm probably going to at least occasionally
want to bust out an equation or two, so I rigged up [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/)
to play nice with Octopress. I should be able to write something like
$x = -\frac{p}{2}\pm\sqrt{\frac{p}{2}^2-q}$.

Maxwell's Equations

    $$
      \begin{aligned}
      \nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{B}} -\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{E}}}{\partial t} & = \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{\mathbf{j}} \\
      \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{E}} & = 4 \pi \rho \\
      \nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{E}}\, +\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{B}}}{\partial t} & = \vec{\mathbf{0}} \\
      \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{B}} & = 0
      \end{aligned}
    $$

Since that all looks to be working, welcome aboard.

I can't promise I'll update this often, and I can't promise I'll say anything
worth reading, but it's 2014... by now, we should all be getting to work
by jetpack. At least I'm not promising something I can't deliver.
